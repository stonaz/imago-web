			<h2 class="title">Michele Ruggieri’s Atlas of China</h2>
<h4 class="title"><i><b>di </b>Eugenio Lo Sardo</i></h4>
<div class="presentazione">
Pompilio Ruggieri was born in 1543 in Spinazzola, in the Kingdom

of Naples, which at the time was part of the  Spanish empire. He 

was the only son of the administrator of an important noble family, 

the Orsini  from Gravina. He studied law in Naples and held public 

offices, such as that of judge. In 1570, he moved to Rome, two years 

later joined the Society of Jesus assuming the name of Michele and 

in 1573 decided to study theology with the Jesuits at the Collegio 

Romano. He arrived in Macao in 1579 and succeeded in founding his 

first missionary house, in Zhaoqing, in December 1582. In 1588 he 

was sent to Rome to organize a papal embassy for the imperial court 

of Beijing. He died in Naples in 1607.<br><br>
  
The forty folios containing the maps he produced, which remained

unpublished until 1993,  constitute the oldest and most accurated

map-making by a Westerner in China. This was not Ruggieri’s only 

groundbreaking achievement.  He was the first European to have 

a book printed –  Tianzhu shilu  (&#22825;&#20027;&#23526;&#37636; , A  True Record of the 

Lord of Heaven) in China and, in collaboration with Matteo Ricci, he 

compiled the first Portuguese-Chinese dictionary.<br><br>
Ruggieri  never finished the atlas, on which he worked for more

than twenty-five years, from his arrival in Macao until 1606, the

year before he died. Even though many plates have been lost or

dispersed,  those remaining  describe all fifteen provinces of China 

in the Ming era. These are preceded by a general linking map, called 

Tamincuo,  and a single Chinese map of Leautum. Other brothers 

must have collaborated on the work, and it is certain that an important 

contribution was made by a still anonymous Chinese colleague, who 

was undoubtedly well-educated. The work is based on a number of 

original sources, including an edition of the Guang yu tu (&#24291;&#36671;&#22294;).<br>
With extreme intelligence, Ruggieri grasped the extraordinary

importance of the use of cartography by the Chinese for 

administrative purposes. This technique was completely unknown 

in Europe, where only several centuries later were geographical 

and cartographic descriptions of the countries produced.  With the 

sensitivity he had shown in his years of residence in the great eastern 

empire – which he loved deeply, as can be seen in the poems he 

wrote – he succeeded in performing an essential role as a linguistic 

intermediary, which was not fully understood, because he was way 

ahead of his time. He was able to establish a profound dialogue with

his Chinese friends, and when he returned to his native land he was 

welcomed by the highest political and religious authorities of the 

time. For essentially political reasons regarding the complex relations 

between Spain and the Papacy, he remained on the sidelines of his 

own society, although Antonio Possevino used him as a consultant 

for his fundamental pedagogical work, which was addressed to the 

missionary world.<br><br>
Thanks to Ruggieri and his books, China began to get to know

Europeans and  they got their first inkling of the other half of the

world.	</div>		</div>
